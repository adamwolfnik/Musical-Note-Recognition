# Musical-Note-Recognition
Musical sounds each have a certain pitch that we can differentiate as notes also known as musical notes. This project describes a way to create a system that recognizes these musical sound waves and determines the note's pitch and octave according to the standard piano middle C scale.
The basic formula for the calculating the frequency of musical notes of the equal tempered scale is given below
Fn=F0*(a)n
Where,
F0 = the frequency of a reference note. (which must be chosen) In this report we have chosen ‘A’ above middle ‘C’ ‘(A4)’ for which F0 = 440 Hz.


n = the number of half steps away from the reference note for a particular specified note. If you are at a higher note, ‘n’ is positive. If you are on a lower note, ‘n’ is negative.


Fn = the frequency of the note n half steps away.


a = (2)1/12
